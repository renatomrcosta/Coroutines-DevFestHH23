Presentation Link: https://www.canva.com/design/DAFyNVx4pw0/pu1Zlc09eyDai_APX79W2A/view

This repo has two main source sets:

* Samples
  * The bulk of the coding samples used live on stage are contained here, ordered alphabetically in their respective packages
* spring-demo
  * A sample Spring Boot project that was used to convert from a default Reactor project to take advantage of coroutines. To start it, one also needs to have a running docker environment, which will spin a mongo instance up.
